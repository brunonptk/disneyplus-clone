Using React, GraphCMS and GraphQL to make a Disney+ clone


# Using React, GraphCMS and GraphQL to make a Disney+ clone

# add assets

First, you need to create your GraphCMS Account and add assets to it.

# cd

Create your directory and put the files inside it. Open your VSCode or any other IDE, open the directory and write cd to get inside it. Example: directory disney that you created and inside it there is the file disney-clone that you also created and inside disney-clone there are the files that you downloaded. Then you write cd disney-clone and press enter to get inside it. 

# add a .env file

After the assets are loaded, add a .env file with the following:

GRAPH_CMS_TOKEN={your_token}
ENDPOINT={your_endpoint}

# npm i

Run the command above in your terminal to install the packages.

# run

Run the development server by writing this in your VSCode terminal:

npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
